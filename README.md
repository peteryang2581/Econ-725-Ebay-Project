# Econ-725-Ebay-Project

In this project, we investigate how to explain and predict the winning bid as well as the probability of whether the car is sold or not by using key auction and product characteristics. 
	The project uses the dataset (Lewis, 2011) that contains information on eBay used car auctions and machine learning methods such as basic linear model, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest. The results show that the auction settings, the information disclosed by sellers, and the product characteristics all have significant effects on the price of the winning bid, and the probability of the vehicle being sold. The recommendations for sellers about auction settings and information disclosed for the most popular car model will also be addressed in the paper.
